# readme-generator

Description

This project is for self-improvement and practice in order to provide myself with confidence within this industry.

This is a README generator to quickly create a professional README for a project.

Installation

To install the project, I've initiated my local working folder into a GitHub Repository, then pushed the local files to the Repository after adding and commiting the updated codes using VSC.

Please download Node in order to run this app.

This application uses file system and inquirer module.

Usage

Use the inquirer to answer questions to create your README.
